Project Templates
#################

Project templates are example project structures that may include things like
contracts, deploy scripts, and tests all ready to go.  They can help you get
common project structures setup with a simple :code:`sb init -t [template]`
command.

For instnace, you can get an ERC20 project structure setup pretty quick like so:

.. code-block: bash

    sb init -t erc20

For now, the only options are `bare` and `erc20` but there may be more to come
in the future.
