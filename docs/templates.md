# Solidbyte Templates

Templates are example project structures that may include things like contracts,
deploy scripts, and tests all ready to go.  They can help you get common project
structures setup with a simple `sb init -t [template]` command.

For instnace, you can get an ERC20 project structure setup pretty quick like so:

    sb init -t erc20

For now, the only options are `bare` and `erc20` but there may be more to come
in the future.
