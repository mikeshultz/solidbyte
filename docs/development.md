# SolidByte Development

If you're looking to hack on SolidByte, you're in the right place.

## Testing

TBD

## Release

Build and upload a TestPyPi release:

    ./release.sh

## Linting

flake8 is used for linting to PEP8 conventions.  Best to configure it with your
preferred IDE, but you can also run it with the command `python setup.py lint`

## Docstrings

Use [Google's Python doctstring format](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).
