    This is a massive test spanning a ton of components.  Can this be broken down at all?  Or maybe
    forced to run last somehow?  This is more or less a large integration test.  If some small
    component fails, this test will fail.  So if you have multiple tests failing that include this
    one, start on the other one first.
